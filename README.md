# chess

My attempt to build a relatively simple chess playing game in order to learn Python 3.5.

Requirements:
   Requires colorama 0.3.7.  
   
   To obtain, download the .tar.gz from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama
   
   tar xvf colorama-0.3.7.tar.gz
   
   python3.5 setup.py install
   
   Likely would work fine with later versions of colorama, I just have not tested beyond 0.3.7
